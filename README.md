# Food2Fork Recipes List
Sample android app using retrofit, room, coroutines and dagger

The app uses Food2Fork API (https://www.food2fork.com/about/api).

To compile and fetch the data you will need to sign up and get an API key for the API.

Add this key to the project local.properties file:
```
food_2_fork_api_key = "API_KEY"
```
